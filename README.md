# AC Heating XCC Heat Pump Controller Integration

Read-only Home Assistant integration for AC Heating XCC heat pump controllers with photovoltaic integration. Monitor your heat pump system directly from Home Assistant with automatic entity discovery and bilingual support.

Inspired by work in https://github.com/Pdobry/xcc-graph.

## 🏠 Home Assistant Integration Features

- 🔧 **470+ settable fields** automatically discovered across 8 configuration pages
- 📊 **Live data monitoring** with real-time sensor values
- 🌐 **Bilingual support** (English/Czech with auto-detection)
- 📋 **Organized by device** (heating, PV, hot water, auxiliary source, etc.)

## 📦 HACS Installation

1. **Add Custom Repository**:
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant
   - Click the 3 dots (⋮) → "Custom repositories"
   - Add repository: `https://github.com/pvyleta/xcc-integration`
   - Category: `Integration`

2. **Install Integration**:
   - Go to HACS > Integrations
   - Search for "XCC Heat Pump Controller"
   - Click "Download" and restart Home Assistant

3. **Configure Integration**:
   - Settings > Devices & Services > "Add Integration"
   - Search for "XCC Heat Pump Controller"
   - Enter your XCC controller details

## 🔧 Development & Testing

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pvyleta/xcc-integration
   cd xcc-integration
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Tests

The integration includes comprehensive tests to ensure reliability:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

## 📚 Configuration Pages

The integration automatically discovers entities from these XCC pages:

| Page | Description | Typical Entities |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Heating Circuits** | Temperatures and schedules. Every circuit the controller reports as enabled is polled; the first keeps bare `xcc_to_*` names, further circuits are namespaced `xcc_okruh<n>_*` | Temperature sensors |
| **Photovoltaics** | Battery management and export limits | Power sensors |
| **PV Inverter** | Inverter configuration and telemetry | String/phase sensors, inverter settings |
| **Hot Water** | Sanitization and circulation | Water temperature sensors |
| **Auxiliary Source** | Backup heating system | Status and binary sensors |
| **Spot Pricing** | Dynamic pricing optimization | Price sensors |
| **System Status** | Overall system information | Status and binary sensors, diagnostic data |
| **Heat Pump Settings** | Advanced configuration (discovered dynamically) | Configuration sensors |
| **PV Battery SOC** | Monthly battery state-of-charge target curve | State-of-charge sensors |

## 🧰 Standalone Tools

The repo root ships a few helper scripts, separate from the integration in `custom_components/xcc/`. They do **not** share code with the integration (auth and page lists are duplicated). Current status:

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `find_hidden_switches.py` | Offline analysis of scraped XML to list hidden `_BOOL_i` switch fields | ✅ Works (needs `fresh_tuv_data/` or `tests/sample_data/`) |
| `xcc_scraper.py` | Download all controller pages to disk | ⚠️ Partially broken — only the inline fallback client path works; the `custom_components/xcc` import path is API-incompatible |
| `xcc_cli.py` | Interactive CLI to browse/search controller fields | ❌ Broken — depends on `field_database.json` and `scripts/analyze_known_pages.py`, neither of which exists in the repo |

These are kept for reference/backup workflows. See [XCC_SCRAPER_README.md](XCC_SCRAPER_README.md) for scraper usage and caveats.
