# XCC Home Assistant Integration Changelog

All notable changes to the XCC Heat Pump Controller Home Assistant integration.

## [1.15.17] - 2026-08-03

### ✨ New Features

#### **Per-circuit heating-circuit entities**
Only one heating circuit ever reached Home Assistant. Every circuit's data page
(`OKRUH10.XML` = circuit 0, `OKRUH12.XML` = circuit 2, ...) carries the *same*
unprefixed `TO-*` prop names and they all share one descriptor — `okruh.xml` is
byte-identical for every `?page=N` — so circuits collided on prop-keyed entity
ids. In practice they never even got that far: `_normalize_page_to_device`
reduced `OKRUH11.XML`/`OKRUH12.XML` to the keys `OKRUH1`/`OKRUH12`, neither of
which is in `_DEVICE_PRIORITY`, so those circuits' entities were **silently
dropped** after being fetched.

- Circuits above 0 are now namespaced to `OKRUH<n>-*` (e.g. `OKRUH2-KONSTANTA`
  → `number.xcc_okruh2_konstanta`). **Circuit 0 keeps its bare `TO-*` names**, so
  every existing entity_id, unique_id and its recorder history is untouched.
- Only `TO-*` props are namespaced. The system-wide props an okruh page also
  carries (`SVENKU`, `BLOKYSPOTREBY-*`, `FVE-*`, ...) keep their global names and
  continue to dedupe against the other pages that publish them.
- Secondary circuits inherit circuit 0's descriptor (entity type, unit, select
  options, writability) via a base-prop fallback in
  `lookup_with_normalized_fallback`, and are qualified in the UI as
  `Okruh <n> <name>`.
- Writes route to the owning circuit's data page; the POST still uses the bare
  `TO-*` name that page actually publishes.
- Discovery now polls the circuits `main.xml` reports as **enabled** (the
  `INPUTV` bit), instead of probing a fixed `OKRUH10`/`OKRUH11` guess — which
  both polled switched-off circuits and missed enabled ones.

Covered by `tests/test_circuit_namespacing.py` (19 tests) against a real
`OKRUH12.XML` sample.

## [1.15.16] - 2026-07-17

### ✨ New Features

#### **Self-reported data-gathering alert**
A flaky controller can keep dropping some data pages while a poll still
"succeeds" (`fetch_pages` returns an `Error:` string for the pages it missed),
so those entities go stale/unavailable silently. The integration now tracks that
itself:

- **`binary_sensor.xcc_data_incomplete`** (device_class `problem`, diagnostic) —
  turns **on** after `DEFAULT_MISSING_PAGE_ALERT_POLLS` (5) consecutive polls
  that either miss ≥1 expected data page or fail entirely (~10 min at the default
  120 s scan), and clears automatically on recovery. It is **always available**
  (computed from the coordinator's streak counters, not from a data page) so the
  alarm persists through the outage it reports. Attributes expose the missing
  pages and streak counts. Alert on it directly (e.g. notify when it is `on`).
- A matching **Repairs issue** is raised/cleared in tandem for at-a-glance
  visibility in Settings → Repairs.

Auth failures don't trip it (they have their own reauth flow). Detection logic is
pure (`entity_helpers.missing_data_pages` / `next_gather_health`) and covered by
`tests/test_data_gathering_health.py`.

## [1.15.15] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

#### **Switch / sensor / select entities randomly stuck "unavailable" after setup**
`sensor.py`, `select.py`, and `switch.py` each called
`coordinator.async_config_entry_first_refresh()` inside their forwarded
`async_setup_entry`, even though `__init__.async_setup_entry` already performs
that first refresh once, before forwarding platforms. The redundant call
re-fetches every data page; if it races the per-page 10 s timeout (made more
likely by the extra `FVESOC1.XML` page added in 1.15.12 — "21/21"), it raises
`ConfigEntryNotReady` from *within* the forwarded platform. The other platforms
have already set up, so the entry is left partially loaded and the losing
platform's entities are never re-registered — they show `unavailable` (a
restored registry entry with no live entity) until a manual reload. Which
platform loses is a race; a stuck `switch.xcc_to_config_chlazeni` left an
AC-Heating cooling swap-set un-actuatable (the master cooling bit could not be
turned off).

Removed the redundant call from all three platforms; they now read the
already-loaded `coordinator.data` directly (as `number.py` / `binary_sensor.py`
already did). A failed first refresh now fails the *whole* entry cleanly (HA
retries it) instead of silently dropping one platform.

#### **`FLASH-HEADER*-DATETIME` (and other datetime fields) raised ValueError every poll**
The `CAS`→`h` unit heuristic in `descriptor_parser._infer_unit_from_context`
matched the substring `TIME` inside `DATETIME` / `TIMESTAMP`, so datetime labels
like `FLASH-HEADER0-DATETIME` (value `01.01.1970 00:00`) got the numeric unit
`h` and a `duration` device_class. HA then coerces the state to float and raises
`ValueError` on every read (~2000×/session observed), and the three FLASH-HEADER
datetime sensors failed to add entirely.

- `descriptor_parser`: the `CAS`→`h` carve-out now also skips
  `DATETIME` / `DATUM` / `DATE` / `TIMESTAMP` props (generalising the existing
  POCASI guard). Genuine hours-durations (`PROVOZHODIN`, ...) still get `h`.
- `sensor.py`: belt-and-suspenders — any field whose resolved `data_type` is
  `datetime` / `date` / `time` / `string` has its numeric unit stripped, which
  also catches data-only `_DT_` fields (e.g. `SCAS`) that never pass through a
  descriptor.

Added `tests/test_first_refresh_and_datetime_unit_fix.py`.

## [1.15.14] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

#### **NAST (heat-pump settings) page produced no entities**
The NAST settings page advertised in 1.12.1 never actually populated on the
controller. `_check_additional_pages` fetched a single **`NAST.XML`** data
page, but the controller echoes the `nast.xml` *descriptor* back for that name
(no `<INPUT ... VALUE=...>` values) — so `OMEZENIVYKONUGLOBALNI` and ~144 other
NAST settings (`B0-I`, `OFFSETBAZ`, `MZO-ZONA0-OFFSET`, the power-restriction
knobs) came up empty.

The real values live in **`NAST1.XML` / `NAST2.XML` / `NAST3.XML`** — one data
page per `<block data="NASTn">` in the descriptor (`OMEZENIVYKONUGLOBALNI` is in
the NAST2 block). Two fixes were needed:

- **`_check_additional_pages`**: fetch `NAST1/2/3.XML` instead of `NAST.XML`.
- **`_normalize_page_to_device`**: fold `NAST2.XML` / `NAST3.XML` into the
  `NAST` device — previously they normalized to `NAST2` / `NAST3`, which are
  absent from `_DEVICE_PRIORITY`, so their entities were silently dropped.

Added `tests/test_nast_pages.py` (+ `NAST1/2/3.XML` fixtures) pinning the
descriptor→data→device pipeline end to end.

## [1.15.12] - 2026-06-28

### ✨ New Features

#### **FVE-SOC Page (PV battery SOC curve)**
- **ADDED**: `fvesoc.xml` / `FVESOC1.XML` page discovery and integration. It is not referenced from `main.xml`, so it is registered explicitly via `_check_additional_pages` and the static page lists.
- **ADDED**: 12 writable monthly battery state-of-charge target setpoints (`FVE-SOCCONFIG-SOCCURVE0..11`, unit `%`), grouped under the existing **Photovoltaics** device.
- **ADDED**: `set_value` routing so SOC-curve writes target `FVESOC1.XML` instead of being misrouted to `FVE4.XML`.
- **ADDED**: `tests/sample_data/fvesoc.xml` + `FVESOC1.XML` fixtures and `tests/test_fvesoc_pages.py` regression tests.

### 🧹 Housekeeping
- **FIXED**: README rot — removed stale MQTT install/integration sections (the MQTT path no longer exists), updated HACS instructions, refreshed the module list.
- **DOCS**: Flagged the partially/fully broken standalone tools (`xcc_scraper.py`, `xcc_cli.py`) while keeping them; added a project `CLAUDE.md`.
